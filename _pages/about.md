Welcome to my page! I am a dynamic professional with a rich background in CRM management, public speaking, and creative problem-solving. Most notably, at The Data Storytellers, I spearheaded a complex CRM transition from Pipedrive to HubSpot, mastering automation workflows and data management, and skillfully navigated website DNS challenges during pivotal website migrations.

My journey also includes a stint as a Game Master at i-Exit Escape Rooms, where I developed my skills in relationship building and multitasking, managing multiple interactive experiences simultaneously. This role significantly enhanced my public speaking abilities, often engaging with groups as large as 30.

Academically, my background in Economics and Film Production has provided me with a versatile skill set. While Economice has opened doors in various industries, my love for film has nurtured a passion for VFX and video editing, which I continue to pursue as a fulfilling side-hustle.

Currently, I'm actively seeking new opportunities that align with my long-term goal of excelling in project management/DevOps. My experiences have equipped me with a unique blend of technical savvy and creative acumen, making me an ideal candidate for roles that require both analytical thinking and innovative problem-solving. If you're looking for someone who can bring a fresh perspective to your team, or if you'd like to collaborate, please feel free to reach out!
