![Squamish, British Columbia](/images/Squamish.jpg){: .align-right width="300px"} 
Welcome to my page! I am a certified scrum master (PSM 1) with an academic background in film production and economics. I have a diverse skillset that spans from process improvement to content creation to empathy and relationship building. I am also proficient in a plethora of software, including HubSpot, Zapier, Adobe Creative Suite, Notion, Python, and more. I am currently open to contract or full-time work through my sole proprietorship.

Outside of work, I am an avid gym-goer and sports bettor. When I have down time I'm usually either reading, playing Rocket League, or coding.

## Self-directed study
Despite graduating from Simon Fraser University in 2021, I have never stopped learning. I completed Google's [Data Analytics Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/certificate/ZBC43V6S5GKM) on Coursera, and I am HubSpot Certified in the [Sales](https://app.hubspot.com/academy/achievements/32l0scv4/en/1/david-dugan/hubspot-sales-software) and [Marketing](https://app.hubspot.com/academy/achievements/xrcss8jf/en/1/david-dugan/hubspot-marketing-software) Hubs, as well as in [HubSpot Email Marketing](https://app.hubspot.com/academy/achievements/kl4m66ms/en/1/david-dugan/email-marketing). I am also on Week 6 of [Harvard's CS50: Introduction to Computer Science](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science), which I expect to complete by the beginning of the new year.
