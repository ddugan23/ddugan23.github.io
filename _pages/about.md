![Squamish, British Columbia](/images/Squamish.jpg){: .align-right width="400px"}
Welcome to my page! I am a twenty-six-year-old American currently living in Vancouver. Up until now, my academic and professional pursuits have exposed me to a wide range of industries and technologies, and, as a result, I have been able to develop a relatively diverse skill set. These skills span from project management, to content creation, to workflow creation and automation, to proper utilization of AI tools like ChatGPT and Midjourney, and more. In addition, I spend much of my free time learning to program. Over the last few months, I took part in [Harvard's CS50: Introduction to Computer Science](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science) course where I was prompted to solve problems in a variety of languages, including C, Python, SQL, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript. I took the principles I learned from the course, and applied them in my own work, some of which can be found in the [Projects](https://ddugan23.github.io/projects/) tab.

My academic pursuits in Economics (B.A.) and Film Production (A.A.) have been instrumental in shaping my professional trajectory. Economics has provided a foundation in analytical thinking and versatility, applicable across multiple industries. Concurrently, Film Production allowed me to learn about content creation and narrative construction, elements that are quintessential in the realm of marketing and communication strategy development. The synthesis of these disciplines has given me a unique perspective, allowing for the application of storytelling principles in data-driven environments.

However, perhaps more important than technical expertise is the development and application of soft skills. I am a lifelong soccer player, I have over three years of experience in customer-facing roles, and I have worked with senior leaders in Data and Analytics from Fortune 500 companies. These experiences have led me to understand the importance of teamwork and effective communication, and I hope to continue to leverage these skills to excel in all future pursuits.

I am primarily seeking roles in operations or project management, and while my industry focus is on SaaS or IT services, I am generally open to most industries. My goal is to secure a position where there is a clear trajectory for leadership and ample opportunities for professional development. Additionally, while my focus is on these roles, I am also open to opportunities in marketing or sales, as I believe both are critical skills that are beneficial even beyond business settings.

If you're looking for someone reliable and hard-working who can bring a fresh perspective to your team, or if you'd like to collaborate, please feel free to reach out! As a sole proprietor, I am open to both full-time positions and contract work.

Oh yeah, and outside of work I'm a bit of a gym bro, I'm an avid watcher and bettor of most major sports (I promise my all-time P/L is positive), I play chess, and I have an affinity for a number of arcade and PC-based rhythm games.
