![Squamish, British Columbia](/images/Squamish.jpg){: .align-right width="400px"}
Welcome to my page! I am a twenty-seven-year-old American living in Vancouver. I am currently working as the Junior Service Operations Coordinator at [FISPAN](https://fispan.com), a financial services company that has partnered with 11 of the top U.S. banks - including J.P. Morgan Chase - with combined assets exceeding $3T. Up until now, my academic and professional life has exposed me to a wide range of industries and technologies, and, as a result, I have been able to develop a relatively diverse skill set. These skills span from automation and workflow creation, to project management, to content creation, to proper utilization of AI tools like ChatGPT and Midjourney, and more. In addition, I spend much of my free time learning to program. Over the last few months, I took part in [Harvard's CS50: Introduction to Computer Science](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science) course where I was prompted to solve problems in a variety of languages, including C, Python, SQL, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript. I took the principles I learned from the course, and applied them in my own work, some of which can be found in the [Projects](https://ddugan23.github.io/projects/) tab.

My academic pursuits in Economics (B.A.) and Film Production (A.A.) have been instrumental in shaping my professional trajectory. Economics has provided a foundation in analytical thinking and versatility, applicable across multiple industries. Concurrently, Film Production allowed me to learn about content creation and narrative construction, elements that are quintessential in the realm of marketing and communication strategy development. The synthesis of these disciplines has given me a unique perspective, allowing for the application of storytelling principles in data-driven environments.

However, perhaps more important than technical expertise is the development and application of soft skills. I am a lifelong soccer player, I have over three years of experience in customer-facing roles, and I have worked with senior leaders in Data and Analytics from Fortune 500 companies. These experiences have led me to understand the importance of teamwork and effective communication, and I hope to continue to leverage these skills to excel in all future pursuits.

Oh yeah, and outside of work I'm a bit of a gym bro, I'm an avid watcher and bettor of most major sports (I promise my all-time P/L is positive), I play chess, and I have an affinity for a number of arcade and PC-based rhythm games.
